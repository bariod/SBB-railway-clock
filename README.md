# SBB railway clock

The iconic clock of the SBB (Swiss Federal Railways) implemented in HTML and JavaScript using `CanvasRenderingContext2D`.

The second hand fully rotates in just 58.5 seconds and waits at the top until the 60 seconds have passed.

It gets updated every 10ms - because 100FPS should be smooth enough. 

Feel free to adjust the canvas size and the `tick` interval!
